![hex sticker for gabs](https://github.com/vdtobias/Gear-Avoidance-Behavior-Simulation/blob/master/images/hex_blue.jpg) 
* R code to simulate a behavioral response to sampling gear that is similar to a response to predators.
* The purpose of this code is to investigate the effect of individual behavioral response on sampling results
