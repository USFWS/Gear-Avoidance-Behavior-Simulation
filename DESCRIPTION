Description: This package simulates the escape behavior of fishes during
    sampling. It is based on a conceptual model of predator avoidance behavior.
    It relies on input from the user for information such as the size of the
    sampling gear (net), the speed of the tows, and the swimming capabilities
    of the fish species of interest. It was developed to evaluate assumptions
    in sampling for Delta Smelt in surveys conducted by the Interagency Ecological
    Program's long-term monitoring program, but this package allows extension to
    other similar gears and additional fish species. This is a work in progress.
